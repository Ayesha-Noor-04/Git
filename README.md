# Git
A C++-based Git-like version control system that manages large CSV datasets using tree data structures (AVL, B-Tree, Red-Black Tree). Designed for collaborative environments, the system offers branching, commit history, Merkle hash-based integrity checks, and efficient file synchronization across multiple virtual servers.
